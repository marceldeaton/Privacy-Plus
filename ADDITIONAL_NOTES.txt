Owner actions & recommended next steps

1. Repo setup
   - Add  files to the repository root.
   - Create docs/ with API reference, architecture diagrams, and ROADMAP.md.
   - Add .github/workflows/ci.yml for tests and linting.

2. Legal checks
   - Have legal counsel review ENTERPRISE_LICENSE.md and CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md before use in commercial contracts.

3. Release
   - Tag an initial release v1.0.0 once core functionality and tests are in place.
   - If you plan to publish packages (npm / PyPI), reserve package names and prepare CI publishing workflows.

4. Automation
   - Add pre-commit hooks and linting rules in the repo (pre-commit, ESLint, black, etc.).
   - Add Dependabot or other dependency scanners.

5. I can:
   - Commit these files on a branch and open a PR (provide repository URL and branch name).
   - Replace example server endpoints with production endpoints.
